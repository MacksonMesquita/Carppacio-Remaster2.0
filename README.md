This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![Next JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=next.js&logoColor=white)
![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### A clone? üåÄ

To avoid confusion, is important to point out that another project in another repo inspired this one.
You can tell by going to the *First react fictional page* repository on the main screen.

The main objective of this repo is to optimize and upgrade everything I learned in the initial learning process, using React and common CSS settings,
For this, I didn't create a project from scratch, but I used the entire "universe" previously created as a basis.
<br />
Everything you will see here has been improved using good conduct and programming practices, along with:

* New frameworks - **like Tailwind CSS**

**If you don't know what it is, go to the doc**

> [Learn Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

### Some warnings ‚ùó
* This repo don't have support for other languages, some contents was written in Portuguese (Brazil).

* Some things were imported from react component libraries, in order to make the event more practical and easier to handle

* For all intents and purposes, this repo will no longer be updated after its final version, any content deficiencies or lack of updates will be unavailable!

* This repo was made during learning process
  
* Tailwind css can be found here, instead of the normal CSS configuration
